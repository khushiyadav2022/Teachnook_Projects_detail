# teachnook_Projects
I have completed internship from teachnook where I have worked on some projects like Countdown timer, Data Scientist Salary prediction, Potato Price Forecasting, Web Scrapping from beautiful soup etc.

**Countdown Timer**<br>
A countdown timer is a program or device that counts down a specified amount of time, often used for timing events or tasks. In Python, a countdown timer can be created using the time module and a while loop to print the remaining time until the timer reaches zero. The duration of the countdown is set as a variable and decremented by one each time the loop runs. Once the countdown is complete, a message can be printed to indicate that the timer has ended.<br>

**Data Scientist Salary Prediction**<br>
The Data Scientist Salary Prediction project is an example of a data science project that involves building a machine learning model to predict the salary of a data scientist based on various factors such as education, experience, location, and industry.

The project typically involves the following steps:

- Data Collection: Collecting data from various sources such as job portals, company websites, and social media platforms.<br>
- Data Cleaning and Preparation: Cleaning the collected data and preparing it for analysis by handling missing values, outliers, and transforming the data as required.<br>
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the data to gain insights and understanding of the relationships between the features and the target variable.<br>

**Potato price forecasting**<br>
Governments use historical data, market trends, and expert analysis to forecast potato prices. They collect data on potato production, consumption, imports, exports, and prices over time, and monitor factors that can affect potato prices, such as weather conditions and transportation costs. They develop models using statistical techniques to predict future potato prices, with the goal of providing accurate information to stakeholders in the potato industry.<br>

**Web scrapping**<br>
Web scraping is the process of automatically collecting data from websites. Beautiful Soup is a Python library used for web scraping. When scraping Amazon customer reviews using Beautiful Soup, the following steps may be taken:<br>
- Send a request to the Amazon customer review page and receive a response from the server containing the HTML code of the page.
- Use Beautiful Soup to parse the HTML code and extract the desired data, such as the customer reviews and ratings.
- Navigate through the HTML code using Beautiful Soup's various methods, such as find(), find_all(), and select(), to locate the specific elements of the page that contain the data of interest.
- Use regular expressions or other data cleaning techniques to further refine the extracted data.
- Store the scraped data in a desired format, such as a CSV or JSON file, for further analysis.
- Overall, web scraping with Beautiful Soup allows for efficient and automated data collection from websites, including Amazon customer reviews.<br>
