# teachnook_Projects
I have completed internship from teachnook where I have worked on some projects like Countdown timer, Data Scientist Salary prediction, Potato Price Forecasting, Web Scrapping from beautiful soup etc.

**Countdown Timer**<br>
A countdown timer is a program or device that counts down a specified amount of time, often used for timing events or tasks. In Python, a countdown timer can be created using the time module and a while loop to print the remaining time until the timer reaches zero. The duration of the countdown is set as a variable and decremented by one each time the loop runs. Once the countdown is complete, a message can be printed to indicate that the timer has ended.<br>

**Data Scientist Salary Prediction**<br>
The Data Scientist Salary Prediction project is an example of a data science project that involves building a machine learning model to predict the salary of a data scientist based on various factors such as education, experience, location, and industry.

The project typically involves the following steps:

- Data Collection: Collecting data from various sources such as job portals, company websites, and social media platforms.<br>
- Data Cleaning and Preparation: Cleaning the collected data and preparing it for analysis by handling missing values, outliers, and transforming the data as required.<br>
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the data to gain insights and understanding of the relationships between the features and the target variable.<br>
